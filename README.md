Hi, I'm Aryan â€” a Computer Science student at the University of Virginia passionate about building scalable backend systems and solving problems with code. My GitHub showcases a mix of real-world engineering projects, machine learning models, and full-stack applications. 

Notably, I developed a distributed **Food Ordering System** using Spring Boot, Kafka, Docker, and the Outbox Pattern to demonstrate microservices communication and transactional consistency â€” a project built from the ground up following Domain-Driven Design. I also created a **UVA Course Picker**, a JavaScript tool that helps students optimize their schedules based on GPA, timing, and professor preferences.

In the data science space, Iâ€™ve worked on a **Fake News Detection model** and a **Taiwan Bankruptcy Prediction** project using XGBoost, SVM, and PCA to classify companies based on financial indicators. Additionally, Iâ€™ve explored event-driven systems in Python, used CNNs for **Traffic Sign Recognition**, and built stock prediction models using KNN, logistic regression, and LSTMs.

I aim to continuously learn and build projects that blend software engineering with data-driven thinking. Thanks for checking out my work!
