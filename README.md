Hi, I'm Aryan, a CS student at UVA whoâ€™s into building cool backend systems, solving real problems with code, and learning by doing. 

My GitHub showcases a mix of real-world engineering projects, machine learning models, and full-stack applications. One of my favorites is a distributed **Food Ordering System** using Spring Boot, Kafka, Docker, and the Outbox Pattern. It is all set up using microservices communication and transactional consistency, a project built from the ground up following Domain-Driven Design. I also created a **UVA Course Picker**, a JavaScript tool that helps students optimize their schedules based on GPA, timing, and professor preferences.

In the data science space, Iâ€™ve worked on a **Fake News Detection model** and a **Taiwan Bankruptcy Prediction** project using XGBoost, SVM, and PCA to classify companies based on financial indicators. Additionally, Iâ€™ve explored event-driven systems in Python, used CNNs for **Traffic Sign Recognition**, and built stock prediction models using KNN, logistic regression, and LSTMs.

I aim to continuously learn and love projects that blend software engineering with data-driven thinking. Thanks for checking out my work!

## Pinned Projects

[food-ordering-system](https://github.com/AryanThodupunuri/food-ordering-system)

A backend microservices project built with Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, Docker, and PostgreSQL â€” simulating a full food delivery system with reliable event-driven messaging.

[course-picker](https://github.com/AryanThodupunuri/course-picker)

A JavaScript web app that helps UVA students optimize their course schedules based on GPA, professor ratings, and time preferences.

[SlackLite](https://github.com/AryanThodupunuri/SlackLite)

A real-time messaging app deployed with React (Vercel), FastAPI (Railway), MongoDB Atlas, and AWS S3 for file uploads. Built for low-latency communication with WebSockets.

[Predicting-NBA-Team-Wins-ML](https://github.com/AryanThodupunuri/Predicting-NBA-Team-Wins-ML)

A linear regression model trained on decades of NBA stats to forecast team wins based on point differentials and scoring metrics.

[fake-news-detection](https://github.com/AryanThodupunuri/fake-news-detection)

An NLP classification model that detects misinformation by analyzing news article content using TF-IDF and logistic regression.

[Traffic-Sign-CNN](https://github.com/AryanThodupunuri/Traffic-Sign-CNN)

A Convolutional Neural Network that classifies traffic signs with high accuracy, designed for use in autonomous vehicle systems.

[taiwan-bankruptcy-prediction](https://github.com/AryanThodupunuri/taiwan-bankruptcy-prediction)

A machine learning pipeline using XGBoost, SVM, and PCA to classify companies as bankrupt or not based on financial indicators.
